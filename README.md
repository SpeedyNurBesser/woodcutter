# Woodcutter

This Minecraft datapack adds the ability to cut all wood types into further processed forms like planks, stairs and slabs using the stonecutter.

## Recipes

> I used mangrove wood as an example, but this works with all wood types.

## Why I decided to do stuff the way I did

You might have wondered why you can't craft fences, fence gates, doors and trapdoors using planks in the stonecutter, but can with logs. The reason is that I decided that you should at max get 0.5 extra planks for using the stonecutter instead of the crafting table, as that's the max you get in vanilla, when crafting a stone stair that would cost 1.5 stones in a crafting table. Here's a table about the plank cost of every wooden block that further illustrates the point I'm trying to make here.

|item |planks needed for the recipe (including sticks [1 stick = 0.5 plank])  | recipe output| cost per block (in planks)|
--- | --- | ---| ---|
|stair|6|4| 1.5|
|slab|3|6| 0.5|
|fence|5|3| ~1.7|
|fence gate|4|1| 4|
|door|6|3| 2|
|trapdoor|6|2| 3|
|pressure plate|2|1| 2|
|button|1|1| 1|
|sign|6.5|3| ~2.2|
> Hanging signs aren't on this table, because their crafting recipe includes chains.

If you dislike my decisions, I recommend you check out [Taya's Woodcutter datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tc-woodcutter) which made some things different to this one.
